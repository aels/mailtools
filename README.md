__\{!\} Windows users warning:__ All of these tools are supposed to be __running on Linux or MacOS__. So, if you are Windows user, I recommend you to use WSL (it's in fact Ubuntu core right inside your Windows installation).
Here is instruction, how to enable it on your machine: [https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/install-wsl-with-a-single-command-now-available-in-windows-10-version-2004-and-higher/](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/install-wsl-with-a-single-command-now-available-in-windows-10-version-2004-and-higher/)

### Don't be rude
I'm writing all these tools as part of my workflow, and giving them for free not cuz they are free, but cuz they works and do their job very very well.
Please, respect my efforts and my time. Thank you.
### These tools are still a work-in-progress
These tools are still a work-in-progress and should be mostly usable but may be not yet complete. Please file any bugs or feature requests as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/aels/mailtools/issues)

\[RU\] Пишите, бл*ть в [GitHub issues](https://github.com/aels/mailtools/issues) все баги, пожалуйста. Там их и порешаем. Не спамите личку. Я один, а вас очень много. Спасибо.
